The Text Sequence Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks project focuses on modeling sequential data such as text or time series using LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network. LSTM effectively captures long-term dependencies and patterns, making it ideal for tasks like next word prediction, sentiment analysis, and time series forecasting. This enhances the model's ability to understand context over time.
